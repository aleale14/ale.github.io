I just went through this old (2008) [article](http://www.paulgraham.com/disagree.html) on how we should disagree. 
I found the introduction to be very insightful and, unfortunately, quite spot on.

Few snippets from it:

* "Many who respond to something disagree with it. That's to be expected. Agreeing tends to motivate people less than disagreeing. And when you agree there's less to say."
* "The result is there's a lot more disagreeing going on, especially measured by the word."
* "...though it's not anger that's driving the increase in disagreement, there's a danger that the increase in disagreement will make people angrier. Particularly online, where it's easy to say things you'd never say face to face."
