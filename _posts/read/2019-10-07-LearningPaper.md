[How much is that piece of paper in the window?](https://seths.blog/2019/10/how-much-is-that-piece-of-paper-in-the-window/) is another thought provoking article by Seth Godin.

On the follow up [discussion in Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alessandroalessandrini_emigranti-activity-6577085590636900353-Esxc) to an article on [migrants](https://aleale14.github.io/emigranti) I wrote few weeks ago I was touching upon the changing (i.e. strongly diminishing) relevancy of a university degree to land a job.

A degree is only a paid certification demonstrating you successfully completed a set of more or less updated courses: hopefully you learnt more than something in the process, but did you get the best learning out of the time you invested to get the degree?

I very much doubt it.

As Seth Godin puts it in his article, 

``Learning, on the other hand, is self-directed. Learning isn’t about changing our grade, it’s about changing the way we see the world. Learning is voluntary. Learning is always available, and it compounds, because once we’ve acquired it, we can use it again and again.``

I cannot stress more the importance of learning, to learn continuously and to keep your mind open.

Happy learning!
