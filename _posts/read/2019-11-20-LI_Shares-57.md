Effectively used my flying time ;) 

Binged listened to David Green podcast Digital HR Leaders (https://lnkd.in/dtrEj9j) and enjoyed reading the first few chapters of Scott H Young  book Ultralearning (https://lnkd.in/dWd7yEp).

That's a good way to put myself in the right mood for presenting  the updated job landscape to the colleagues in Madrid
