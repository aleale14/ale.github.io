After few weeks hiatus in which I was too busy mingling with people (and eating), I'm back online and I want to start the year with a short retrospective on my [blogging](https://aleale14.github.io/blog/) experience in 2019 and my intentions for 2020.

Few months back I started rambling in a [blog](https://aleale14.github.io/blog/).

From a very selfish perspective, I found the blogging experience very rewarding on multiple levels as it allowed me to 

 1 Clarify my thoughts, streamline and reassemble them.

 2 Re-connect with old frends and acquaintances as well as establish new connections.
 
 3 Be involved in constructive discussions. 

 4 Be made aware of new trends / interesting related articles, podcasts and conferences. 

 5 Better understand different points of view, many of them clashing with my own ideas. 

I blogged both in **English**, mainly on topics related to my professional environment (i.e. learning & development, people analytics, talent management, competence management, data protection, etc.), and in **Italian**, mainly on topics related to expatriates.

Globally speaking, posts in Italian generated more general discussions both online and offline while posts in English provided many (really a lot) suggestions, tips and new contacts. 

I personally profited by such exchanges and I wish to **thank you for your very precious input**.
An even greater thank you goes to [Pietro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pietromoliterni/), [Dino](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardino-ricci/) and [Andrea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy1/) who contributed with their experiences and ideas to the blog.

To be honest, the possibility to connect with people on topics of (hopefully) mutual interest is by far the greater benefit I got and I do intend to continue in that direction, looking forward to get more contributors on board and to profit from the input of the network.

Happy 2020!
