You really need the time to think things through if you aim at mastering them - reading somebody else opinion and making it your own is a lazy approach, you are just scratching the surface of the issue and you are most probably missing out on the possibility to deep link the new topics with the bulk of your knowledge.

Few snippets:

* We live in a world of scarce understanding and abundant information. We complain that we never have any free time yet we seek distraction. If work can’t distract us, we distract ourselves. We crave perpetual stimulation and motion. We’re so busy that our free time comes in 20 second bursts, just long enough for us to read the gist and assume we understand. If we are to synthesize learning and understanding we need time to think.

* We live in a world with more information than ever and yet we understand less.

* Thinking requires time and space. It’s slow. It means saying I don’t know.
