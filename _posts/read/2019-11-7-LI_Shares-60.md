Data - from new oil to mean to unlock social good. 

Who has the data? Mainly private actors.

What they use them for? To increase their bottom line.

Does society as a whole benefit from it? Barely (and I'm being optimistic).

Could society benefit from unlocking currently private-held data? Most definitely yes.

Few reflections on Alberto Alemanno article  Unlocking Privately-Held Data to the Benefit of the Many - https://lnkd.in/d_Sf9d6
