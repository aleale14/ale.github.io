If you enjoy these notes, please [purchase the book](https://www.amazon.com/Driving-Performance-through-Learning-Employees-ebook/dp/B07ZPGFJCW/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Driving+Performance+Through+Learning)!*

### Introduction
* p.1: Concerned that courses are often a default "go to" when development in-the-flow of work would be more effective.
* p.9: Driscoll's model developed for reflective practice among healthcare professionals. *WHAT* defines the nature of the situation, the status and the context. *SO WHAT* captures reaction and feelings. *NOW WHAT* provides the implications for us to change.
* p.10: Learning in the flow of work at the hearth of daily work activities. Implement learning that drives organizational performance.

### Redefining workplace learning
* p.14: Work is learning, learning is work. Blend experiential / social / formal learning to create a shared organizational learning philosophy.
* p.15: organisms must constantly evolve to survive in an ever changing world - *Evolve or die!*.
* p.16: move from skills to knowledge economy, with information, insights and influencers becoming increasingly valuable.
* p.17: Rather than a career being seen as upward moving, employees will move sideways, taking their skills into other sectors and tapping into opportunities found in networks.
* p.18: Soft skills are more and more important in a transforming work environment. Reskilling is a reality for all.
* p.23: Senge 5 key attributes of learning organizations. *Systems Thinking*: the performance of *all* its component parts is crucial to its overall success. *Personal Mastery*: added value comes from a workforce that learns more effectively than others - the culture must support individual learning, value it and ensure it is embedded in daily operations. *Mental Models*: be aware of existing approaches and biases - be ready to unlearn them and change them. *Shared Vision* underpinning commitment to learning/improvement. *Team Learning*: collaborative structures & systems are put in place to support learning and knowledge dissemination.
* p.26: Move away from learning as an intervention separate from work to integration in the workflow. **Learning is contextual to the work scenario**.
* p.27: Learning drives performance when it is embedded in the workplace context, integrated into work practices and reinforced by colleagues sharing their knowledge (Jarche -> link to Personal Knowledge Mastery setup *seek->sense->share*)
* p.31: Learning philosophy - *why* learning is vital, *what* learning is essential and desirable, *who* is responsible in the learning process, *when and where* learning can be undertaken, *how* it is designed and facilitated (Stitzlein)
* p.34: **Unlearn** - in redefining workplace learning, the issue isn't simply about embracing the new thinking; it requires the 'unlearning' of the old ways.

### Diagnosing needs
* p.43: Relative perceptions have a massive impact in trying to diagnose the key learning needs of an organization
* p.45:  Learning needs analysis -> effective, engaged, healthy workforce -> job satisfaction -> reduced turnover, stress, absenteism
* p.48: 10 question by Clayton <span style="color:red"> *IMAGE*</span>
* p.48: Improving the performance of people must begin with identifying and resolving environmental barriers
* p.49: A course should never be the assumed starting point
* p.51: Performance consulting conversations: look at performance in the context of the wider organizational system, not the needs of an isolated role or individual.
* p.52: Mager & Pipe 7 steps approach: 
    1. What is the performance problem? What should be happening and what is happening in reality?
    1. Is it worth fixing? What would happen if we did nothing?
    1. Can we apply a fast fix (non-training)? Do employees have the adequate tools and resources and feedback?
    1. Are the consequences appropriate? Is poor performance punished or rewarded; are consequences used effectively?
    1. Is the a skills deficiency? Is it a deficiency? Could it be done in the past? Is the skill often used?
    1. Are there other causes? Can the task be made easier? Are there obstacles? Is there potential for change?
    1. Which solutions are best? Are the solutions feasible? What is the cost? What is the implementation plan?
* p.55: Peterline approach: policies, culture, mission, goals & objectives.
* p.59 Aret's matrix <span style="color:red"> *IMAGE*</span>

### Tracking impact
* p.70: Tracking learning impact is essential to drive organizational performance; when resources have been invested they must create an outcome.
* p.81-82: Learning-Transfer Evaluation Model <span style="color:red"> *IMAGE*</span>
* p.85: 15 questions to track impact <span style="color:red"> *IMAGE*</span>
* p.86-88: 12 levers approach <span style="color:red"> *IMAGE*</span>
* p.108: D. Eisenhower 'In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable'. We must move from being fixed to flexible; that means exploring and planning for possible scenarios and responding quickly to the developing operational landscape. A key to achieve that level of agility is organizational learning that's responsive to the emerging needs.

### Designing responsively
* p.110: Agile learning is simply creating a prompt solution to meet a need.
* p.115: SAM1 + SAM2 model <span style="color:red"> *IMAGE*</span>

### Leveraging Digital
* p.136: Digital Learning Solutions Transformational impacts: FACTS - Flexible - able to be accessed easily, anytime, anyplace; Accessible - able to use with ease and without frustrating barriers; Collaborative - able to link me with like minded others; Tailored - able to deliver for my unique requirements; Step-change - able to significantly improve my existing practice
* p. 139: Digital solutions begin with a learner need; if technology doesn't make life easier, it's not the answer.
* p.141-142: 10 Design rules <span style="color:red"> *IMAGE*</span>
* p.147: A shift in connection is needed for learning to be delivered when and where learners need it, and for that we must move to devices that empower learners in their unique context. A new paradigm for learning in-the-flow of work demands that staff don't have to stop work to learn but can access learning in the moment of need; digital connections can provide such immediacy. 

### Facilitating Communities
* p.173-174: Community of Practice: describe development through a process of participation.
    1. The Domain: an area of knowledge or expertise in which the members have a shared competence or interest.
    1. The Community: in pursuing their shared domain interest, members form an active community that participates in discussions, solves problems, and shares knowledge and information.
    1. The Practice: a community of practice is different from a community of interst who gather around a shared like; the members actively engage to develop and shape their knowledge, skills and behaviour through sharing practice, resources, experiences and tracking problems.
* p.174: Communities of Practice differ from work groups or project teams in that their purpose is to develop the members rather than deliver a task / service.
* p.183: The 7 Cs of successful social communities <span style="color:red"> *IMAGE*</span>

### Curating Content
* p.199: Definition content curation -  curation is the art/science of identifying the best information for the organization and providing context and order to it.
* p.207: seek/sense/share model by H. Jarche -> Personal Knowledge Mastery

### Supporting Self-direction
* p.247: We must proactively involve learners in the learning design process, by including them in learning design teams, consulting them during the design process and involving them in testing and evaluation.
* p.249: Summary <span style="color:red"> *IMAGE*</span>

### Embedding Coaching
* p.259: Where there is a coaching culture, it's simply part of the DNA of how things are done. It doesn't need to be planned, it's second nature. It doesn't rely on external specialists but is an embedded approach for all staff.
* p.265: Coaching characteristics <span style="color:red"> *IMAGE*</span>
* p.266 Peter & Austin - 'Management by Walking Around' - catching employees doing something right
* p.267: SBI Feedback Tool - *Situation* describe the where, what and when of the issue; *Behaviour* captures the specific behaviours observed; *Impact* considers how the other person's action affected you or others.
* p.267 Impromptu management coaching relies on:
    1. Cognizance: to be aware of what's happening in the workplace
    1. Connection: to develop strong relationships that can bear honest discussion
    1. Courage: to no miss the value of the moment feedback
* p.279-281: 40 coaching questions
