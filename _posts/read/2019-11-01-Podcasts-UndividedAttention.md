I am more than happy to see the tide changing.
More and more voices are speaking up against a bunch of companies harvesting our data, artificially predicting our behaviours and maximizing their profits without giving so much thoughts about ethical and moral issues as well as the impacts of their activities on the population at large.

I recently found out about the [Centre for Humane Technology](https://humanetech.com) and I'm really enjoying listening to their great podcast [Your undivided attention](https://humanetech.com/podcast/): I warmly recommend it if you want to better understand how we are constantly nudged to benefit not ourselves but some companies and what we can do to improve the situation.
