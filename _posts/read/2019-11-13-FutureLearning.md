###### Educating the Generation that could live on Mars | Ryan Findley | TEDxALC

Yep, another post on learning - it is a topic really close to my heart, a topic that makes me curious and I'm than willing to provide my 2 cents to improve the current status.

Even if I got some degrees few years ago, [I see](https://aleale14.github.io/OnLearning) a diminishing importance for the [piece of paper](https://aleale14.github.io/learningpaper) and an increased focus on mastering first principles, putting them into practice in real situations and keeping on building on top of them to be able to cope with future challenges.

While looking for content related to [Dare to learn](http://www.daretolearn.fi), I stumbled upon the posts of [Ryan Findley](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryanfindley) and kept on discovering some of his activities.
I really enjoyed this [TEDx talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbDUDF4Vbco&app=desktop) in which he challenged the way we educate students, `preparing the leaders of tomorrow with the knowledge of today and the tools of yesterday`.
I found his storyline very compelling and inspirational, connecting well with my (current) [vision](https://aleale14.github.io/L_D_Principles) of how learning and development activities should be carried out. 

Few gems out of Ryan's talk:

`if you're in college today what would you be studying to prepare yourself for the future given everything that's going on in the world? What would you do to prepare yourself for the world of tomorrow? And so I got stuck because what I realized was that I can't study many of the things that I most need today that almost need for tomorrow`

`we have some pretty good ideas about where the world is going and yet I can't major in any of those things today they simply don't exist yet`

`the knowledge of today has a lifespan of maybe 5 or 10 years`

`learning how to learn is just one of the critical skills that young people are going to need to have for the world of tomorrow along with problem-solving and critical thinking along with team work and innovation empathy and resilience quantitative reasoning and systems thinking and with these skills in hand we believe that our young leaders will be ready not only for today but also for tomorrow but that's only if we uncheck all them from yesterday we cannot train tomorrow's leaders with yesterday's approaches to education of lectures and teacher based classrooms and rote memorization`
