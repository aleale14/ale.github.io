What are your experiences with the various types of competency management systems?

I'd cluster them in 3 macro-types:

1. Systems inferring competences from activities performed
2. Systems assessing competences based on a more or less strict framework
3. Systems providing an overview of generic competences needed for generic roles

Size of the company and even more the width of the sectors covered are definitely relevant differentiating factors, but I find that often the best approach for a specific company is more driven by the cultural fit than anything else.
