I'm curious and I really enjoy asking questions as they are a wonderful way to learn, to understand and to get closer to know a topic.
At the same time I am not really somebody that likes doing the same thing over and over again.

So, how to cope with recruitment activities? 
From one side, I am really eager to get to know them, to understand how they tick and how they could make our company better, but from the other side I really get bored of carrying out structured interviews, with the same questions being asked over and over again.
