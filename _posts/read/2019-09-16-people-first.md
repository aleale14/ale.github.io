IBM released few days ago the updated study ["The enterprise guide to closing the skills gap"](https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/report/closing-skills-gap).
It'd be no surprise that the biggest gap is not “digital skills,” but behavioral skills: you could master the former with relative ease compared with the latter. Furthermore behavioral skills are not as portable as digital ones: working across cultures, both at national and company level, is a challenge and people do need to readapt everytime.

Earlier this month the World Economic Forum stressed the importance of social aspects in learning in this [article](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/09/to-build-the-workforce-of-the-future-we-need-to-revolutionize-how-we-learn-wecome-to-digital-learning-2-0/) on new trends in learning ("Digital Learning 2.0 solutions will need to be designed to not just deliver content, but to catalyze people to think critically and collaborate to develop").

 Are we getting the clue that we need to (re)focus our development efforts on the human beings and on how to improve their interactions both with technologies and with other people? Technologies are there to support and make us better, to extend our capabilities, to give us more opportunities, to augment us, to enable us to fly higher.

As Agatha Christie put it, `One coincidence is just a coincidence, two coincidences are a clue, three coincidences are a proof`.
Waiting for the third coincidence...
